## 📝 Coding Standards

### Python (Backend)
- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/)
- Use type hints for function parameters and returns
- Write docstrings for functions and classes
- Use meaningful variable names

Example:
```python
def extract_json_from_response(response: str) -> dict:
    """Extract JSON object from AI response, handling markdown fences."""
    # Implementation
    return parsed_json
```

### JavaScript/React (Frontend)
- Use consistent naming (camelCase for variables/functions)
- Comment complex logic
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components focused and modular

Example:
```javascript
function ChatMessage({ message, sender, thought }) {
  // Component implementation
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Backend Tests
```bash
cd backend
pytest tests/
```

### Frontend Tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

Please add tests for new features and bug fixes.
